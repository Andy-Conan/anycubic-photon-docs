Furthermore you could be oversensitive and thus should take extra precautions. Lastly safety regulations may differ per country and differ from time to time. Take this also into account.

## Types of danger
The following types of exposure are important:
- ingestion
- skin contact
- inhalation

If we read the MonoCure 3D Clear Rapid Safety Data Sheet:
- ingestion: "Immediately give a glass of water. First Aid is not generally required."
- skin contact: "Flush skin and hair with running water (and soap if available). Seek medical attention in event of irritation."
- inhalation: "Avoid breathing vapours..." "Store in tightly closed containers in a properly vented storage area..." " General exhaust is adequate...Local exhaust ventilation may be required in special cirumstances... If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator" "Evidence shows, or practical experience predits, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial nuumber of individuals, following inhalation...No report of respiratory illness in humans as a result of exposure to multiifunctional acrylates has ben found. Similarly evidence of systemic damage does not appear to exist."  

To inderstand the risk of inhalation, see the wiki entry about vapour point https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure
