M_11800 Memory Error
Troubleshooting and Fixes

Try these steps one by one ;

First, remove usb stick and try a power cycle. Switch off, unplug from mains, wait 10 mins, restart. Wait 1 min, plug in usb stick, wait a while, browse files on usb

If not, try a few other usb sticks. No cheap shit, try good known brands formated fat32. 

If not, open back panel, unplug usb extension cabl from mainboard, plug good mini usb stick directly. 

If not, download and update firmware. Be sure to print all the update files in the sequence given. 

If not, try another psu. 12V 6A or higher amps. Possibly power issues causing udisk unmount. 

If not, nothing else you can do unless you're willing to open it up and dive into troubleshooting cold solder joints or driver voltage, etc. 

Contact vendor or anycubic. Mainboard issues.
