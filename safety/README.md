# How to use your Photon, Resins and Cleaning solutions safely?

## Disclaimer
This info below is based upon information from the internet. You should do your own research and make your own assessment of what is safe enough for you. Furthermore you could be oversensitive and thus should take extra precautions. Lastly safety regulations may differ per country and differ from time to time. Take this also into account.

## Types of danger
The following types of exposure are important:
- ingestion
- skin contact
- inhalation

If we read the MonoCure 3D Clear Rapid Safety Data Sheet:
- ingestion: "Immediately give a glass of water. First Aid is not generally required."
- skin contact: "Flush skin and hair with running water (and soap if available). Seek medical attention in event of irritation."
- inhalation: "Avoid breathing vapours..." "Store in tightly closed containers in a properly vented storage area..." " General exhaust is adequate...Local exhaust ventilation may be required in special cirumstances... If risk of overexposure exists, wear approved respirator" "Evidence shows, or practical experience predits, that the material produces irritation of the respiratory system, in a substantial nuumber of individuals, following inhalation...No report of respiratory illness in humans as a result of exposure to multiifunctional acrylates has ben found. Similarly evidence of systemic damage does not appear to exist."  

To inderstand the risk of inhalation, see the wiki entry about vapour point https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure
The MonoCure 3D Clear Rapiud Safety Data Sheet tells us that the speed with which vapours escape is 0.25-0.5m/s when evaporating and 0.5-1.0m/s when pouring and moving an open container. They also explain that "Velocity generally decreases with the square of distance from the extraction point."  

## Duration of danger
Also import for the danger of resins and solvents is the duration of exposure.
The MonoCure 3D Clear Rapiud Safety Data Sheet:
- skin contact: "Practical experience shows that skin contact with the material is capable either of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a substantial number of individuals, and/or of producing a positive response in experimental animals.
Limited evidence suggests that repeated or long-term occupational exposure may produce cumulative health effects involving organs or biochemical systems."
- inhalation: "Long-term exposure to respiratory irritants may result in disease of the airways involving difficult breathing and related systemic problems. Limited evidence shows that inhalation of the material is capable of inducing a sensitisation reaction in a significant number of individuals at a greater frequency than would be expected from the response of a normal population.
Pulmonary sensitisation, resulting in hyperactive airway dysfunction and pulmonary allergy may be accompanied by fatigue, malaise and aching. Significant symptoms of exposure may persist for extended periods, even after exposure ceases. Symptoms can be activated by a variety of nonspecific environmental stimuli such as automobile exhaust, perfumes and passive smoking.
Sensitisation may give severe responses to very low levels of exposure, in situations where exposure may occur."
