# Frequently Asked Questions

## How tight should the leveling be?
If you are using the paper method, the paper should be tight enough to pull but not be able to push, REMEMBER once tightening the level bolt it will move the plate down a tiny bit more, so you should raise / back off the level bout .01mm.
