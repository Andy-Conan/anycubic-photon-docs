# Frequently Asked Questions

## How tight should the leveling be?
If you are using the paper method, the paper should be tight enough to pull but not be able to push, REMEMBER once tightening the level bolt it will move the plate down a tiny bit more, so you should raise / back off the level bout .01mm.

## I can see the supports in my .photon sliced file but not my model
The normals of your model are reversed. Flip them or they wont print.

## How long can I keep the resin in the vat?
It depends on environmental factors and type/brand of resin, typically if the resin is kept out of light and moisture/dirt it may sit in the vat for 1 - 2 weeks. Clear resins tend to sit better, opaque resins will need more stirring before use to mix the pigments back. 
- check for loose cured resin or stuck resin, you will need to clean that out
- cover the vat, you can cut a piece of cardboard that fits over the vat, or print one out on an FDM printer. Here is a good vat cover.https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837171
- Before printing, carefully stir the resin for 1 - 2 minutes with the plastic spatula, be careful not to scratch the FEP screen.
- Do not leave the z bed dangling with uncured resin, take it out and clean with IPA, leave it out untill you are ready to print, this will lessen the weight on the single Z rod thus prevent z wobble. 

## My prints just wont stick
- this is generally a leveling issue, make sure your leveling is 100% correct before attempting the other solutions
- Clean the build plate with IPA.
- Shake your resin well
- Warm the resin, you can use hot hair dryer on most bottles to gently heat the resin while swiling between 20c - 30c
- Did you relevel?
- Loose and floppy FEP sheet, replace or tighten fep - instructions here https://youtu.be/DLi3chV43LQ
- Sanding your print bed with 240 Grit sandpaper stuck on a flat surface until the powder coating is removed, make sure it is completely flat. THIS WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY.

## How long should I cure my print?
The best way to learn if your print has cured enough with sun light or a UV light set up is to find an area where you dont mind a mark and try to dent it with your finger or thumb nail, If you can then it's not ready yet, and as soon as you can't dent it it's ready.

## Help my plate slips during a print!!!
This can happen if the screws that live inside the arm of your build plate (there are three of them in there), Work loose or if because you filled the vat quite high some resin has go inside and is making the grip of the ball joint in there slip about.

There first remove the 4 bolts you can see just either side of the arms holder (the bit with red the platen knob on it) put them some place you can find them again then the housing will be able to open once you have gotten the build plate off you will see three more screws undo and place them in a safe spot too then you can take the mechanism of the ball joint apart be sure to note where it all goes so you can easily put it back together again (this may be a great time to take some pictures for your reference when rebuilding it.

Now you have it all apart clean all the parts with some IPA and remove any cured or uncured resin you find, Then just put it all back together nice and tight and you can re level and start printing nice straight prints again!

## What do the print settings mean?
Bottom Exposures (Bottom layers): this is how long the UV light will turn on to set the layer of resin that is on your build plate for the first few layers (it's extra long to give the resin the best chance to stick to your plate and form a super hard base to help keep your part from wobbling and rocking about)

Bottom layer: (Bottom layers) simple, this one it's about how many of those super hard base layers to lay down on the base of your print usually this is 5-8 layers.

Normal exposures (Normal exposure time) : After your base layers have finished this is the time the UV will be on to cure all the rest of the layers of your print and will always be lower to your base layers setting it can be looked up in the excellent settings chart compiled by Artur Fuste that you can find in the files section of this group.

Exposure off (Off time). it's the amount of time the plate will wait at the bottom of a cycle (Pressed down on the FEP sheet, in the bottom of your vat) Before the UV light comes on for the next exposure longer times leave more time for the resin to settle out and form  a flat layer.
